name: recursive-proving
description: Ask the main Rethlas workflow to delegate decomposition plans to subgoal-prover agents after direct screening has identified the key stuck points. Use when all current plans have been screened by direct proving, none fully solves the problem, and recursive work is needed.

# Recursive Proving

Use this skill when direct proving has failed on the current decomposition plans.

## Input Contract

Read:

- the current set of decomposition plans
- the direct-proving reports and key stuck points for each plan
- the known stuck points from other plans
- relevant `failed_paths`, `branch_states`, and search results

## Procedure

1. Confirm that all current decomposition plans have already been attempted with `$direct-proving` and that none has fully solved the problem.
2. In the current main Claude session, invoke `Agent(rethlas:subgoal-prover)` once per decomposition plan, or process plans serially if concurrent delegation is unavailable.
3. Give each subgoal-prover agent:
   - the full target theorem
   - the assigned decomposition plan
   - the key stuck points for its own plan
   - the key stuck points found in the other plans
   - the instruction to follow the Rethlas project-local runtime contract
4. Tell each subgoal-prover to tackle the assigned plan, treating that plan as its starting point rather than restarting the search from zero. If new evidence or discoveries justify it, the subgoal-prover may refine, extend, or locally revise the plan, but it should preserve continuity with the assigned plan instead of discarding it outright.
5. Tell each subgoal-prover not to spawn further subagents.
6. Require each subgoal-prover to write progress, failures, and any successful proof development back into the shared memory using the same project-local `run_id` as the MCP `problem_id`.
7. Wait for all delegated work to finish, then gather their reports.
8. If any plan succeeds, assemble the proof draft from that plan.
9. If all plans fail, hand the collected reports to `$identify-key-failures`.

## Output Contract

Append an `events` record for the recursive round:

```json
{
  "event_type": "recursive_proving_round",
  "plan_ids": ["..."],
  "subagent_ids": ["..."],
  "shared_stuck_points": {
    "plan_id": ["..."]
  },
  "status": "running|completed",
  "successful_plan_ids": ["..."],
  "failed_plan_ids": ["..."]
}
```

Update `branch_states` with the recursive round status and per-plan outcomes.

## Tools

- `memory_search`
- `memory_append`
- `branch_update`
- `search_arxiv_theorems`
- `Agent(rethlas:subgoal-prover)` from the current main Claude session

## Failure Logging

If every plan fails in the recursive round, append a summary record to `failed_paths` and immediately invoke `$identify-key-failures`.
