name: verify-proof
description: Verify candidate proofs by invoking the Rethlas verifier agent. Use only when a full candidate proof of the entire problem has been assembled in markdown, and before publishing the final verified blueprint.

# Verify Proof

Use the Rethlas verifier agent as the canonical verifier before accepting a solution.
Do not use this skill for partial proofs, isolated subgoals, or branches that have not yet produced a full proof draft of the whole problem.

## Input Contract

Read:

- target theorem statement
- assembled proof blueprint candidate from `.rethlas/runs/{problem_id}/blueprint.md` or `.rethlas/runs/{problem_id}/attempts/{attempt}/blueprint.md` as pure markdown text
- relevant prior failure reports and branch context

## Procedure

1. Read the current candidate `blueprint.md` draft as pure text.
2. First check that `blueprint.md` contains a full proof draft of the entire target theorem rather than a partial proof, fragment, or exploratory notes. If it does not, do not call the verifier yet.
3. Invoke `Agent(rethlas:verifier)` with:
   - `run_id`: the project-local Rethlas run id
   - `attempt`: the current zero-padded attempt number, such as `001`
   - `statement`: target informal statement
   - `proof`: the raw markdown text from `blueprint.md`
   - `expected_output_path`: `.rethlas/runs/{run_id}/attempts/{attempt}/verification.json`
4. Wait for the verifier agent to finish and read the `verification.json` file it reports.
5. Read `verification_report.summary`, `critical_errors`, `gaps`, `verdict`, and `repair_hints`.
6. Return and persist exactly what the verifier returns. Do not rename keys, add keys, or change the JSON structure.
7. Treat the proof as failed if any of the following hold:
   - `verdict` is `"wrong"`
   - `verification_report.critical_errors` is non-empty
   - `verification_report.gaps` is non-empty
8. Only treat the proof as passed when none of the failure conditions above hold.
9. If the proof passes, write `.rethlas/runs/{run_id}/blueprint_verified.md` from the verified draft.

## Output Contract

Append to `verification_reports`:

```json
{
  "verification_report": {
    "summary": "string",
    "critical_errors": [
      {"location": "", "issue": "detailed description of the issue"}
    ],
    "gaps": [
      {"location": "", "issue": "detailed description of the gap"}
    ]
  },
  "verdict": "string",
  "repair_hints": "string"
}
```

Persist the verification service response exactly as returned.

If verification fails, revise `blueprint.md` directly and append to `failed_paths` when a branch is invalidated.

## MCP Tools

- `memory_append`
- `memory_search`
- `branch_update`
- `WebSearch` and `search_arxiv_theorems` when the verifier identifies a missing lemma or gap

## Failure Logging

Always persist verification output, including successful checks.
